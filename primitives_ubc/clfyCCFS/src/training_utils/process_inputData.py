def processInputData(XTrainRC, bOrdinal=None, XTestRC=None, bNaNtoMean=False):
    """
    Process input features, expanding categoricals and converting to zScores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    XTrain: Unprocessed input features, can be a numerical array, a cell
            array or a table.  Each row is a seperate data point.
    bOrdinal: Logical array indicating if the corresponding feature is
              ordinal (i.e. numerical or order categorical).  The default
              treatment is that numerical inputs are ordinal and strings
              are not.  If a feature contains for numerical features and
              strings, it is presumed to not be ordinal unless there is
              only a single string category, in which case this is
              presumed to indicate missing data.
    XTest: Additional data to be transformed.  This is seperate to the training
           data for the purpose of Z-scores and to avoid using any features /
           categories that do not appear in the training data.
    bNaNtoMean: Replace NaNs with the mean, default false;

    Returns
    -------
    XTrain: Processed input features
    iFeatureNum: Array idenitifying groups of expanded features.
                 Expanded features with the same iFeatureNum value come
                 from the same original non-ordinal feature.
    inputProcessDetails: Details required to convert new data in the same way
    XTest: Additional processed input features
    featureNames: Names of the expanded features.  Variable names are
                  taken from the table properties if in the input is a
                  cell.  For expanded categorical features the name of the
                  category is also included.
